http://asamericanasapplepie.org/2017/08/18/breaking-paul-ryan-initiate-impeachment-proceedings/
Paul Ryan has been pressured by enough Democrats and “moderate Republicans” — aka RINOs — to cave in to the fake news media hype over white supremacists and fascism that doesn’t exist. An aide working closely with his personal assistant says Ryan has been feverishly working with others in the party like John McCain and Susan Collins to oust President Trump.There is no official word on the House floor and no article on the docket. Apparently, the RINOs and DemoKKKrats are planning on ambushing the President and the faithful members of the right. What they didn’t expect is for Donald Trump to have someone planted deep inside the offices of each of his enemies.The source inside Ryan’s office said: “Speaker Ryan feels enormous pressure to commit treason against a great man. He’s been plotting this with Mitch McConnell and the rest of the old school swamp monsters. Little do they know they’ll never have the votes.” The faithful have made sure that the 2/3rds majority needed to actually remove a sitting President will never happen. President trump was elected by the biggest landslide in history. He’s not going anywhere anytime soon.Paul Ryan, who won his district with 87 percent of the vote, can count on getting no support in 2018 and will most likely end up binge watching the West Wing on Netflix with John Boehner rather than continuing to serve.
