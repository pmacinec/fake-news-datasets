“Bitch nigga tryna call me broke”

Said Travis Rhineston after opening fire on a Texas Chipotle employee for asking him doe he know ‘Guac’ is extra.

Travis insist that the Chipotle employee was calling him broke after telling him that it would be an extra $1.25 to have Guacomole added to his steak bowl.

“Just got my unemployment and disability check so I’m extra guaped up right now so no way she should be calling me broke” – Travis

Travis will be charged with attempted murder and says if he had to do it all over again he’d ask for double guacamole, because two dollars and fifty cents ain’t nothing to a boss.
