Most friends, and especially running mates in a political campaign, would get a FREE copy of a new book, right?

Well, wrong, if your friend or running mate happens to be Hillary Clinton.

Her running mate, clown Tim Kaine, admitted to MSNBC that he did not receive an advanced copy of Clinton’s new book “What Happened,” and was forced to buy a copy.

Apparently, Clinton needs every penny she can get?
