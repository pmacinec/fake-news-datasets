When the Flint, Michigan water crisis broke out, Democrats did what Democrats do best. They rushed off to blame Republicans. However, this would quickly backfire as shortly after it would be pointed out that Flint was, and had been for some time, ruled by Democrats.

President Trump isn’t playing the “blame game.” He’s taking action to help our fellow Americans living in Flint, proving his campaign promise and inaugural speech promise of being the President for ALL Americans.
