President Trump: The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States have ever implemented. Frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States.  President Trump also slammed the murderous Iranian regime:  President Donald Trump: Its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors… We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles… We cannot abide by an agreement that provides cover for a nuclear program.”
