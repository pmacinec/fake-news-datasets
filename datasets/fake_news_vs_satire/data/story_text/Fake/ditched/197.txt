Today, we remember the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the thousands of Americans who died at the hands of radical Islamic terror.

The attacks occurred sixteen years ago, and still have such a lasting impact on who we are as a country, today.

All those years ago, one very strong New Yorker, named Donald J. Trump, walked through the ruins of the World Trade Center and was instrumental in not only helping our nation heal, but also rebuilding the city that he loves so much.
