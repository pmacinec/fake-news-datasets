Coroner: Body Isn’t Her – Hillary Clinton Faked Her Own Death

Hillary Clinton is gone. No, not dead…just gone. By the time
the coroner got the lab results back from the supposed body of
Hillary Clinton and discovered that it was an imposter, Hillary
was nowhere to be found

In the ruckus and confusion surrounding her untimeley
demise, a suicide ruling that was then rolled back and the
national attention something like this gains, the Butcher of
Benghazi slipped away unnoticed, most likely to a small island
nation somewhere with no extradition treaty.

Former President Bill Clinton, who was grieving with his
daughter when he got the news, said he wouldn’t put it past
her and that all of the shenanigans she pulled over the years
are finally over:

“My wife is a strong woman who wasn’t afraid
to do what needed to be done to get ahead. To
do this means she knew she would be getting
caught soon. I understand her reasonuing but I
don’t agree with her decision or her actions.
She may not be dead but she is dead to me.”

Had it not been for the misrepresentation of a corpse for
identification purposes, no crime was committed, and that
crime only carries a 6-month sentence. For Clinton to do
something this drastic leaves far too many unanswered
questions.

Federal investigators have no order to seek out or apprehend
Clinton, so if she decides to sit on a sunny beach somewhere
until she dies, she’ll probably never be heard from again.
