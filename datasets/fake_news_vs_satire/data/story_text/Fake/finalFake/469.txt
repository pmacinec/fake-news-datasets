According to some sources close to the Clinton family, Bill Clinton is facing some tough situations that are going to make his next week very hard.

It looks like his family and some members of the Rodham clan have been filing into Little Rock all week where Bill is being bedridden at the residence connected with his library.

Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth prince expose some pretty big stuff in an article in The Political Insider. It goes like this:

In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So this is that thing called love, the authors’ interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President ”favored unprotected sex.”

And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and ”new diet” but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.

If they are booking for rooms the only logical explanation is that are preparing themselves to have to stay for a funeral. This family stated that they do not want any state burial or national ceremony if anything happens to both of them in the time when Trump is president as they fear of what Trump is going to say during the process. One spokesman for the Clinton family said:

Donald Trump is mean and vindictive. If something were to happen to one of the Clintons, he could demand to speak at a national service and who knows what kind of disrespect would come out of his childish mouth.
