Judge Andrew Napolitano just joined Fox News to discuss allegations Senator Rand Paul and one other senator were under the watchful surveillance by the Obama administration. He was very close with the Supreme Court Justice Scalia.

He then announced huge news that nobody saw coming

Judge Andrew Napolitano stated that the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia confided in him that he was under the impression that Barack Obama had put the highest and most important court in the land under the eye of the NSA.

Justice Scalia told Napolitano that he frequently thought the court was being watched. And he stated to him that around four or five years ago.

Napolitano said. “If they had to unmask Senator Paul’s name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that. That’s not what he’s talking about. They’re talking about unmasking him when he’s having a conversation with his campaign manager when he’s running in the Republican primary.”

He went on to say that Obama should be subpoenaed to testify, even though he would lie about it if he saw the unmasked intelligence.

The Obama administration watching the Supreme Court means they had no qualms about watching everyone that didn’t support every moronic step they made.

Constantly selling this nation down the river to our enemies and Obama found it appropriate to watch everyone else because he was untrusting. He was untrusting because he was untrustworthy.

It’s now wondered that if Scalia was killed to keep things quiet. The autopsy won’t be done now, and the late Justice deserves to rest in peace.

Napolitano making that announcement is just another piece of damning evidence against Obama and his minions.

Good job Obama. Way to violate the Constitution every way you could.
