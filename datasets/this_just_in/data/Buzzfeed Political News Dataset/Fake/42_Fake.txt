Earlier tonight, Ted Cruz announced he was getting out of the race for the Republican Nomination. Cruz was defeated by Donald Trump through a particularly large margin. To this point, Ted Cruz had served as Donald Trump’s strictest competitor in the often contentious race.

Following the loss, Donald Trump commended Cruz for serving as his greatest competitor and said he was a smart guy. Immediately after Ted Cruz announced he was no longer running for president, he swiftly excited the facility where his press conference was held.

Approximately one hour after leaving the campaign site, Ted Cruz was spotted in a nearby store purchasing trash bags, bleach, and a shovel — fueling rampant speculation that he was none other than the Zodiac Killer getting back to his old ways.

While making the purchase, Cruz could be seen pacing back in forth mumbling the lyrics to “Mad World” by Gary Jules underneath his breath.

The Ted Cruz campaign has vehemently denied up to this point that Cruz could be the elusive Zodiac Killer but images released online seem to paint a very different picture.

When asked by the clerk what he was using the items for, Cruz said he was “getting back to work” and handed him a card with a mysterious symbol.
