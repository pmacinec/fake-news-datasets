Some Evangelical Christians are beginning to hold presumed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in high esteem. Several Evangelicals, including walking gaffe former Rep. Michelle Bachmann, already believe Trump, the thrice married, casino magnate, who appeared on the cover of Playboy, has been ordained by God.

But televangelist Pat Robertson has taken it one step further. He believes Trump is on par with Jesus Christ.

“God came to me in a dream last night and showed me the future,” said Robertson. “He took me to heaven and I saw Donald Trump seated at the right hand of our Lord.”

According to Raw Story, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, a 12,000-member megachurch, said Trump would make a better candidate than Jesus.

“You know, I was debating an evangelical professor on NPR, and this professor said, ‘Pastor, don’t you want a candidate who embodies the teaching of Jesus and would govern this country according to the principles found in the Sermon on the Mount?’” said Jeffress. “I said, ‘Heck no.’ I would run from that candidate as far as possible, because the Sermon on the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this nation.”

“When I’m looking for somebody who’s going to deal with ISIS and exterminate ISIS, I don’t care about that candidate’s tone or vocabulary, I want the meanest, toughest, son of a you-know-what I can find — and I believe that’s biblical,” said Jeffress.
