Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince have released a bombshell report about former President Bill Clinton that could end Hillary’s campaign!

In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President “favored unprotected sex.”

And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and “new diet” but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.

As Rush Limbaugh opined, looking at Bill Clinton on the campaign trail,  Rush only sees Preparation H, Geritol, Fixodent, and Depends. Bill Clinton looks like his health is on a rapid recline.

Bill Clinton is roughly the same age as President George W. Bush. But while Bush looks healthy, Clinton only becomes older and frail.

Even a former Clinton White House advisor admits Bill looks unhealthy and “washed-up”:

“I didn’t recognize the character that was on TV,” Morris said of Bill Clinton’s recent interview with NBC News in a video released Monday. “He was washed-out, he was listless, he was apathetic, he was very slow-talking and even slower thinking!”
