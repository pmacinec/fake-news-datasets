Former first lady Barbara Bush said Friday that she doesn’t understand how women can vote for Donald Trump after his attacks on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.
Mrs. Bush sat alongside her son, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, in an interview on “CBS This Morning,” where the two attacked Mr. Trump as misogynistic and vulgar after he recently used the word “s–” onstage during a campaign rally.
“I don’t think a president would have ever shouted profanities in a speech in front of thousands of people with kids in the crowd. He does it all the time,” said Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida.
“Yes, I mean unbelievable,” Mrs. Bush responded.
His mother lambasted Mr. Trump for his ongoing attacks Ms. Kelly, including comments widely interpreted as referring to her menstrual cycle, Reuters reported.
