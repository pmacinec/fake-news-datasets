Newt Gingrich has been waging an INSANE jihad against Donald Trump over the Mexican Judge comments made earlier in the week. Many people are going to be disappointed by this, but Newt flipped sides because of the money.

The mainstream media reported earlier last month that Sheldon Adelson was willing to contribute $100 million to Trump’s campaign. It was not reported much, but there was another $100 million that was offered to Trump if he picked Newt Gingrich. That’s why Gingrich was so nice to Trump.



When Trump the entire offer.declined the entire offer. Gingrich started lashing out at him publicly. He even recently claimed that the comments Trump made about the judge were “one of his worst mistakes.” All Trump did was point out publicly that the Trump University lawyer has ties to the La Raza Hispanic nationalist organization.

“I DON’T KNOW WHAT TRUMP’S REASONING WAS, AND I DON’T CARE,” GINGRICH TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST.

What a traitor. It’s hard to see it happen because a lot of people were hoping that Newt would be the VP. It is now showing that he is just bitter for having Trump change his mind.

It’s in Trump’s best interest to pick someone that identifies with him ideologically as his VP. This makes a lot of sense because Gingrich has done an almost complete 180 since last week. But, we shouldn’t be too torn up about it – remember that Newt Gingrich wanted a moon base at one point.



*** Bye, Bye, Newt. Have fun as the leader of the moon. You’ll probably see the wall from there.
