Voters on the right have been waiting for this for a long time! Police have finally raided a Democratic strategic headquarters, and the results are devastating!

According to Philadelphia Newspaper recently, the Pennsylvania State Police raided Democrat-linked group FieldWorks looking for evidence of voter fraud.

What the warrant says exactly is not known but agents on the scene said they were searching for “templates . . . utilized to construct fraudulent voter registration forms” and “completed voter registration forms containing same or similar identifying information of individuals on multiple forms.”

FYI, Fieldworks LLC is one of the largest national voter registration groups in America. They are working indirectly for the Democratic National Comittee and Mrs. Clinton.

They quickly claimed that they are against voter fraud, but then again, who would actually admit that anyway?
