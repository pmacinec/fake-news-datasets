Right after Donald Trump won the primary and caucus voting on Tuesday night, Donald Trump delivered a victory speech where he made an effort to reach out to voters that supported other candidates. He especially targeted Bernie Sanders supporters.

“TO THOSE WHO VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE, IN EITHER PARTY, I WILL WORK HARD TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT, AND I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO EARN THAT SUPPORT,” TRUMP DECLARED.

“TO ALL OF THOSE BERNIE SANDERS VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD BY A RIGGED SYSTEM OF SUPERDELEGATES, WE WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS,” HE PROCLAIMED

Trump then mentioned all the terrible deals that Sanders has been shouting about since he announced his campaign. He said that he would get rid of those deals in order to protect American workers. This is how Trump will save America. He will not sell us out.


The media has worked hard to stop people from seeing what has been happening, Trump has been pulling the disillusioned Democrats that have already seen the light. They see that the America is getting crapped on by the rest of the world.

*** It’s good to see that even hardcore Democrats hate Hillary Clinton as much as Trump Nation does.
One Bernie Supporter named Juanita Mae Ish Poloskey wrote the following on Facebook:

“SUPER! WE NEED BERNIES VOTERS TO COME TO TRUMP! I WAS A DEMOCRAT ALL MY LIFE, THIS YEAR I BELIEVE TRUMP IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN GET AMERICA BACK!!!”

Another Bernie supporter wrote: “I and a bunch of Bernie supporters will be voting Trump this November. I refuse to vote for someone who sells the American people out to foreign entities.”

That last comment received more than 8,751 likes in only a couple of hours.

Another Democrat named Mac Zeff wrote: “My family hast traditionally been Democrats. We are voting TRUMP this time around. If Hillary is the best the Democrats can produce for the working class, its time to disband the Democrat party.”

*** Things are not looking good for Hillary Clinton.
