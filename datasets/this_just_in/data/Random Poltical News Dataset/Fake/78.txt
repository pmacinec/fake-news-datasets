The Democrats thought they had the election “in the bag”. CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NYT, Huffington Post, and a whole host of other news stations were calling a big Trump loss from day one.

They had to eat their words when the American People showed up on November 8th to prove them dead wrong.

But What Happened Hillary?
We are all familiar with the countless leaks that performed catastrophic damage against the Democratic Party. But, in reality, all it did was show the lies, deceit, and corruption already taking place. Nothing that we saw is new, and it should be a bold wake-up call to anyone who believes what our government tells us without thought or question.

The #1 Reason For The Democrat’s Historic Loss
When the dust settled, however, it was clear that the Democratic Party created a wave they never saw coming; they never expected the American People to rise up by the thousands to declare their disgust for the Washington status quo.

How did they create this wave? Their initial strategy elevated Trump. They intended to use Trump as a “Pied Piper” candidate they would use to portray the Republican Party in a bad light. Their failed strategy was revealed in WikiLeak 1120.



Great job Hillary! Your attempt to put Conservatives in a bad light ended up backfiring big time. You didn’t get to steal the Election. No, instead you awakened the ever-awake silent majority waiting to take back this great land.

So, thanks Hillary for being so, so pretentious and ignorant. Your historic loss will ring forever in American History as future generations will come to know you as one of the most corrupt and deceitful politicians ever.
