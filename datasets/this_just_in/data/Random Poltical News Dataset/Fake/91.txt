Hillary Clinton’s brother-in-law Roger Clinton was arrested over the weekend in Los Angeles. According to reports, he was driving under the influence.

TMZ reported the arrest the other day. It came days before California’s primary. This just looks bad on her. These are the type of people the Clinton family produces: alcoholics.

*** I bet she is losing it right now.

That dunce is Hillary Clinton's Brother-in-law

Roger Clinton was arrested after 8 PM in Redondo Beach. According to TMZ, “He was booked for driving under the influence, he remains in police custody. His bail is set to $15,000.”

*** You can see the kind of kin that the Clinton’s keep on display here.

They are a family of criminals. They know how to steal and do drugs. Bill Clinton allegedly loves to snort coke with any hooker he can find and Hillary Clinton loves to threaten people. They are a pair made for each other in hell. Toss in the brother-in-law and you’ve got trio that’ll make Freddie Krueger look like a nice person.


Look at that picture above. Now, look at this picture of Hillary Clinton. Tell me which one is scarier below in the comments.

“UNLESS HE BAILS OUT BEFORE TUESDAY … THERE GOES ONE VOTE FOR HILLARY,” TMZ SAID.

Hillary Clinton needs all the votes she can get. If you remember, Bill Clinton pardoned Roger Clinton for cocaine-related charge as his final executive act as president. (h/t Daily Caller)
