New documents scheduled to be released this week by Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, could reveal damaging information about NASA’s Apollo program, believe experts.

Julian Assange, who has lived at Ecuador’s London embassy since June 2012 in fear of being extradited to the United States to face espionage and conspiracy charges arising from the leaking of thousands of secret diplomatic and military documents by US Army private Chelsea Manning, has announced that he will release incriminating evidence that the government of the Unites States of America and NASA have hidden the truth about the Apollo program and the lunar landings for more than 40 years.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is about to reveal documents that could prove the Apollo space program was an elaborate scheme to dupe the Russians into a space race that never occurred
Damaging information for NASA

The documents to be released this week could cause up a stir weeks after NASA has announced it is preparing for another moon landing mission in 2030.

«These documents that have been entrusted to me come from a highly known and respected high ranking official of the U.S. government who desires to leave this as a testament to the world before he dies. His desire is to stay anonymous as to not embroil his family and friends into a major polemic that could possibly destroy their lives» he told reporters.

Top officials of the Chinese space program last year accused the government of the United States of “faking” the moon landings after the Chinese lunar rover found no evidence of the Apollo program moon landings after investigating the same area where the Apollo 11 mission allegedly landed on 20 July 1969.
