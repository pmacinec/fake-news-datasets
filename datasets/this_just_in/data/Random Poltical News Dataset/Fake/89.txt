Y’all are gonna get a REAL kick outta this one. So remember how the Mainstream Media wouldn’t shut up about Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in the popular vote by 2.8 Million? Well, that is technically true, but they left out one MAJOR fact…

IF YOU DISCOUNT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY MORE THAN 3 MILLION VOTES IN THE OTHER STATES!!



You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.

In fact, by those numbers, it is safe to say that California alone is the ENTIRE reason Clinton won the popular vote and California does NOT speak for the entire country.

This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T – Daily Mail)

Newt Gingrich brilliantly stated,

“THIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. A TEAM CAN HAVE MORE YARDS AND LOSE THE GAME. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MANY POINTS YOU PUT ON THE BOARD.”



So it looks like the brilliant system set up by our founding fathers worked out just the way it was supposed to.

I’m sure a bunch of crybabies will still try and say “he didn’t win”, but if they do, just look them in the eye and say “Welcome to America, B*TCH! This is what Freedom Tastes Like…”
