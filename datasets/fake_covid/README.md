FakeCovid is the first multilingual cross-domain dataset of 7623 fact-checked news articles for COVID-19, collected from 04/01/2020 to 01/07/2020(with a monthly update). We have collected the fact-checked articles from 92 fact-checking websites after obtaining references from Poynter and Snopes. We have manually annotated the collected articles into 11 categories of the fact-checked news according to their content. The ultimately generated dataset is in 40 languages from 105 countries. We have built a classifier to detect fake news and predict its class. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.76 to detect the false class and other fact check articles. For more detailed information about the FakeCovid dataset, you can refer to the paper.
