{{NewThought}}

== A ==

* [[Abiding Presence]] - the Spirit of God, which permeates everything.
* [[Absolute]] - the God principle, the Supreme, the Unknowable, Unthinkable, Unmanifest—yet manifest in all. The Unconditioned, yet in every condition. 
* Absolute and relative - refers to the Unconditioned Cause and any effect which It may project. 
* [[Abstract]] - in the realm of the formless; apart from any particular object, as in the realm of ideation. Abstract thought is in the higher ranges of thought, rather than in the concrete, as in particular objects. 
* [[Abundance]] - since thought produces fact, then fact must be like the thought which produces it. Hence a thought of impoverishment would create an impoverished condition, while the recognition of abundance would inevitably produce abundance.  
* Accumulated Consciousness — the sum total of all that one has ever said, thought, done or seen, consciously or un-consciously.
* Active ideas of truth - a spiritual treatment is a definite statement, an active state of consciousness created for a definite purpose. 
* Active right thinking - mental treatment is an active thing; it sets about to demonstrate or prove a certain point in Mind through the definite activity of consciousness. Treatment is always active; it is never day-dreaming.
* [[Adam]] - undeveloped, or unenlightened man. The opposite of the Christ Principle, as "in Adam all sin, so in Christ all are made free from sin" (1 Cor. 15:22).
* Adam as Christ - the first Adam is of the earth; the second Adam is the Lord from heaven. Adam as Christ means lifting up the principle of Reality within us to a comprehension of its union with Spirit.
* [[Adam Kadmon]] - in the Kabalah this term means the ONE (son) of the Divine Father. 
* [[Affirmations (New Age)|Affirmation]] - see supreme affirmation, subconscious denial of our affirmations, tool of affirmation, 
* Affirmation in mental treatment - affirming the Divine as the only Presence. That is, affirming the presence of whatever ought to be.
* Affirmation of truth - any statement which affirms the supremacy of good or which denies the reality of that which is contrary to good. (See also spiritual affirmations; transforming power of thoughts and words.
* Affirmative factor - the invisible Power that concentrates primordial substance into new forms. It is the principle of the unfoldment of life through the Intelligence that permeates all space, the very Nature of Being Itself as Subjective Intelligence. Cooperating with It, man may create his world of perfection.
* [[Agnosticism]] - (agnostic) The doctrine that neither the nature nor the existence of God nor the ultimate character of the universe is knowable. Any doctrine which affirms that all knowledge is relative and uncertain.
* [[Akasha]] - space, or ether, as a mind principle.
* [[Alchemy]] - a medieval science, the object of which was to try to transmute base metals into gold. In the life of the metaphysician, the term alchemy is used in referring to the transmutation of the lower nature (that is, the qualities of ruthless selfishness, greed, cruelty, etc.) into the perfect spiritual Form, toward which man is evolving. The uncovering of the God-self, which already exists, potentially, in each one. This alchemy, or transmutation, is an actual chemical change in the cells of the body, through the use of mental law and high spiritual aspiration. 
* All is mental or spiritual - not only is the invisible Principle of Life a thing of mind and spirit, form also is mental and spiritual. It is Spirit caught in a temporary mold for a definite purpose.
* All is mind - all creation is Mind in form and responsive to the Intelligence which creates it. This same Intelligence in us therefore responds to us. [[Immanuel Kant]] said that we are able to recognize an apparently external object by reason of the fact that it awakens an intuition within us.
* All thought is creative - it would be impossible to assume that one type of thought would be creative without assuming that all types must be.
* [[Alpha and Omega]] - this symbolizes all that God is—Spirit, Matter. The first and the last, and all that lies between. The beginning and the end.
* [[Altar]] - symbolizes spiritual idealism upon which are sacrificed the lower forms of thought.
* [[Analogous]] - similar or bearing some similarity. The principle that like attracts like, in that we attract that to which our thought is attuned.
* [[Analogy]] - that which resembles something else. An agreement between two things in some ways, but not identically. In metaphysical teaching, stories are told which bear a resemblance to the thing being illustrated, in order to clarify the thought on the subject at hand. The teachings of Jesus are filled with analogies.
* Analytical realization - realization arrived at by analysis, argument, process of thought, etc.
* [[Ancient of Days]] - God, Spirit, Reality; that which never changes.
* [[Ancient wisdom]] - the continuous stream of Truth that has run through all the great spiritual and philosophic teachings from times of antiquity. The Wisdom of the Ages.

* [[Appearance]] - any objective manifestation which may or may not be considered true to the spiritual Reality. (See also 'Judge not according.")
* [[Archetypal man]] - spiritual man viewed generically, in whose image all men are formed. The universal man. The image and likeness of God.
* [[Archetype]] - the ideal form, written about by Plato. The eternal, perfect concept of things, existing in the Mind of God, or Universal Mind, after which form is patterned. The perfect pattern of a thing in thought.
* Argument of doubt - any mode of thought which denies us the privilege of accomplishing a healing or of making demonstrations for ourselves or others. This arises out of the race consciousness.
* Argument of error - subjective thought patterns of experience resisting any attempt to neutralize them.
* [[Ark of the Covenant]] - the Principle of Unity within us; the Holy of Holies; the Secret Place of the Most High; the Sacred Name; the Scroll of Life; the realization that God and man are One.
* Ascending arc of the circle - a term used to symbolize the evolutionary Force, both personal and cosmic, by which the individual rises from gross materiality into the realm of pure Spirit. The resurrection principle. 
* [[Ascetic]] - one who devotes himself to a solitary and contemplative life; one who practices extreme rigor and self-denial.
* [[Asceticism]] - refers to the doctrine that the material or carnal world is evil or despicable, and that salvation is gained by mortification of the flesh.
* "As he thinketh in his heart so is he" - as the inner state of consciousness is, so will the condition become. (See also [[James Allen's]] ''[[As A Man Thinketh]]'')
* Assimilation and elimination - metaphysically interpreted, this means the circulation of Truth eliminating anything unlike Itself.
* [[Atomic intelligence]] - the primary Intelligence inherent in the very substance of things; the Intelligence in the atom that keeps it revolving around its central unit of power. This Intelligence is characterized by responsiveness, which may be made use of in healing work. Every atom in every cell of the body has intelligence.
* [[Atonement]] - the old Jewish doctrine of redemption through suffering or sacrifice to expiate for a sin. To make amends for an offense. We all atone for wrongdoing, in that the Law of Cause and Effect punishes us until we learn to stop making mistakes. Metaphysical students now realize that the only atonement—that is, the real redemption—is an At-One-Ment with Life Itself, God. Through unity the old accounts are settled and dissolved. (See also ''Atonement Understood'' by [[Home of Truth|Annie Rix Militz]])
* [[Attachment]] - to be bound by sense objects, so that it is painful to be without them.

* [[Baptism by fire]] - the purging of the conscious and unconscious processes of thought whereby mental patterns are transmuted from a material into a spiritual consciousness.
* [[Baptism by the Holy Ghost]] - pure spiritual intuition transcendent of intellectual processes. The Light of Heaven. A state of consciousness which is no longer a symbol nor a purging, but which is a deep interior awareness of peace, poise, power, wholeness, and perfection. 
* [[Baptism by water]] - symbolic of one's consciousness that he is immersed in Life—liquid Spirit. 
* [[In the beginning|Beginning, in the]] - the starting point of any creation. That out of which all experience is projected.
* [[Being]] - in its absolute sense, God, Spirit, Reality. (See also Truth of being.)
* Belief, change of - changing our psychological patterns of thought to the acceptance of that which includes the Allness of God, relative to any fact or experience.
* Belief is a certain way of thinking - no matter how spiritual the belief or the faith may be, it is still an act of consciousness, hence it can be reduced to a state of thought.
* Belief, Law of - belief creates its own law, which is changed only by reversing the belief.
* Believe in your heart - refers to the positive inner conviction.
* "Believe not every spirit" - this refers to the psychic confusion of believing that subjective forms are always what they claim to be.

* Bound by mortal belief - to be controlled by race suggestion. 
* Bound by our own freedom - mind is "the law that binds the ignorant and frees the wise." The thought of limitation creates limitation; the thought of freedom creates freedom. Since limitation is a limited viewpoint of Reality, a greater viewpoint automatically heals the limitation. Thus, we are apparently bound and actually set free by one and the same Law. 
* Bowl of acceptance - refers to our mental attitudes, which, as it were, are held up that the outpouring horn of plenty may fill them. 
* [[Bread of Heaven]] - the Truth as spiritual food for the soul. (See also "I am the bread of life.") 
* [[Breath]] - the Life of all beings; symbolic of spiritual action which breathes thought into form and withdraws form into thought. The word Spirit comes from the Latin word spiro, meaning breath. We read in the Bible that "God breathed into man the Breath of Life, and man became a living being." To breathe is to live. Every living thing is a part of the Great Breath, from the very plants, up through the animal kingdom, to man. The breath is a part of the Action of God in man and is quite beyond man's control. In ancient teachings we are told the Great Breath was the beginning of life and energy on the planet. "And the Spirit of God [the Breath] moved upon the waters." 
* [[Burning bush]] - refers to the thought that all nature is alive with the Divine Presence. It is the recognition of this Divine Presence which causes the voice to proceed from nature. That is, we commune with God through nature.
